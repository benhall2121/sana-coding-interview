# This is a coding challenge for Sana Benefits.

A demo website of this code can be found [HERE - http://sanabenefits.herokuapp.com](http://sanabenefits.herokuapp.com)

## Directions

The directions for the challenge are: 

* Use the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid's NPI (National Provider Identifier) API to build a doctor look-up tool.
* API info is available [here: https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/registry/help-api](https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/registry/help-api)
* The interface should take the doctor's name and state as inputs.
* Once results are fetched, the UI should display their full name, NPI number, and a list of addresses for each result.

* You may use any framework / libraries that you would like, or none at all.
* Once complete, zip up your source code and send it over for review.

* We're looking for a few things here:
  * - Overall execution
  * - Code readability
  * - A clean front-end (we don't expect you to be a designer, but the UI should be easy to understand how to use)

## Setup

Using 

* Ruby 2.5.1
* Rails 5.2.3
* React
* Using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/) for the layout
* No database needed because we are not saving anything
* [Heroku server](http://sanabenefits.herokuapp.com)
* No tests because this is such a small app
